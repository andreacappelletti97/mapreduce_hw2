## Programming technology
All the simulations has been written in Scala using a Functional Programming approach.

While writing the simulations the following best practices has been adopted

- Large usage of logging to understand the system status;


- Configuration libraries and files to provide input values for the simulations;


- No while or for loop is present, instead recursive functions are largely used into the project.


- Modular architecture (code is divided by module to enhance mainteinability)

## Installation
There are mainly two ways to run them: through IntelliJ or via command line.

This section explains how to properly run them.

In order to run the simulations on IntelliJ we have first to clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/andreacappelletti97/cloudsimplus_hw1.git
```
